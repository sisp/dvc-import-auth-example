# DVC Import Example with Access Credentials

This repository contains an example of how to create a private data registry with DVC ([_Project A_](https://github.com/sisp/dvc-import-auth-example/tree/project-a)) using [GitLab's generic packages repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/generic_packages/) as the DVC remote and import data from there in another project ([_Project B_](https://github.com/sisp/dvc-import-auth-example/tree/project-b)). For simplicity, _Project A_ and _Project B_ are branches in this Git repository.
